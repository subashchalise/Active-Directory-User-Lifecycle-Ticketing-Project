# 🛠️ Active Directory User Lifecycle & Ticketing Project

## 📋 Project Overview
This project simulates a real-world enterprise IT environment using the **JobSkillShare (JSS)** professional lab sandbox. I designed and implemented a tiered **Organizational Unit (OU)** structure from scratch to manage the full user lifecycle while resolving common Help Desk tickets.

### 💻 Environment & Tools
| Component | Specification |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Lab Environment** | JobSkillShare (JSS) IT Pro Sandbox |
| **Domain Controller** | Windows Server 2022 |
| **Client Workstation** | Windows 11 Pro (Domain Joined) |
| **Domain Name** | `ACILABS.COM` |
| **Organization Name** | Forest City Tech Solutions (FCTS) |

## 📂 Active Directory Design (OU Structure)
I built a professional, scalable hierarchy under the FCTS root OU to ensure the directory stays organized as the company grows:

```text
ACILABS.COM (Root)
└── FCTS (Top Level OU)
    ├── Groups (Security Groups)
    ├── Users (Employee Accounts)
    │   ├── IT
    │   ├── HR
    │   └── Marketing
    └── Computers (Workstations)
```

 ## 🎫 Help Desk Ticket Simulation



### 🟢 Ticket 1: New Hire Provisioning & Security Onboarding
> Scenario: A new hire, Sarah Jenkins (sjenkins), joined the IT department. My goal was to set up her account following the company’s security and folder structure.

#### **Technical Actions:**
* **Implementation:** Created the user object `sjenkins` within the **FCTS > Users > IT** Organizational Unit. This ensures she automatically receives the correct department settings.
* **Access Control:** Created the `IT-Group` Security Group in the **Groups** OU and assigned Sarah as a primary member.
* **Security Policy:** Enabled `User must change password at next logon` so that Sarah is the only person who knows her permanent password.
* **Verification:** Logged into the **Windows 11 Client** workstation as `sjenkins`. Executed the `whoami /groups` command to verify that the Kerberos Security Token was correctly issued with the new group SID.

#### **📸 Technical Evidence:**

## 🎫 Ticket 2: Identity Recovery & Security Reset

**Scenario:** Michael Chen (**mchen**) from the **HR Department** reported a total loss of workstation access. After several incorrect login attempts, his account was automatically locked by the domain’s security policy to prevent unauthorized access.

---

### 🔍 Diagnostic: Identifying the Lockout
To confirm the issue, I accessed the **Active Directory Users and Computers (ADUC)** console and performed the following checks:

* **Account Status:** Navigated to the **Account** tab in Michael’s properties. A system message confirmed: *"This account is currently locked out."*
* **Deep Dive (Attribute Editor):** Enabled **Advanced Features** to inspect the `badPwdCount` attribute. This confirmed that login attempts had exceeded the domain's threshold, triggering the security lockout.

---

### 🛠️ Technical Implementation
I performed a secure administrative reset to restore access while maintaining credential privacy:

1.  **Account Unlock:** Used the **Reset Password** tool in ADUC to clear the `ADS_UF_LOCKOUT` flag.
2.  **Security Flags:** Enabled the following mandatory flags:
    * **Unlock the user's account:** To restore immediate access.
    * **User must change password at next logon:** To ensure "Administrative Zero-Knowledge" and uphold the principle of non-repudiation.

---

### ✅ Verification & Recovery
I confirmed the resolution on the **Windows 11 Client** workstation:

* **Authentication Test:** Successfully logged in using a temporary password.
* **Password Challenge:** The system immediately prompted the user to create a new, private password.
* **Result:** Access was fully restored, and the account status in Active Directory returned to "Normal."

## 🎫 Ticket 3: Security-Focused User Offboarding

**Scenario:** An employee, **James Wilson (jwilson)**, has resigned from the Marketing department. My task was to quickly and securely disable his account to ensure he no longer has access to company files or the network.

---

### 🛠️ 1. How I Secured the Account
In the **Active Directory Users and Computers (ADUC)** console, I followed standard security procedures to lock down the account:

* **Account Disablement:** I right-clicked James’s account and selected **Disable Account**. This immediately stops any new login attempts.
* **Credential Reset:** I reset his password to a random string. This acts as a "double-lock" to make sure his old password cannot be used for any background services or cached logins.
* **Group Cleanup:** I removed his account from the **Marketing-Group**. This ensures that even if the account were re-enabled by mistake, he would no longer have access to private department folders.

---

### 📂 2. Organizing the Directory
To keep the "Active" users separate from people who have left the company, I moved the account to a secure location:

* **OU Migration:** I moved the `jwilson` user object from the **Marketing OU** into a dedicated **Disabled Users** (or "Leavers") OU.
* **Why this matters:** This keeps the Active Directory clean and prevents the system from applying new company policies (GPOs) to an account that is no longer in use.

---

### ✅ 3. Verification & Testing
I confirmed the account was fully locked by performing the following checks:

* **Visual Check:** In ADUC, James’s account icon now shows a **small black downward arrow**, confirming the account is officially disabled.
* **Login Test:** I attempted to log into a **Windows 11 workstation** using the `jwilson` credentials.
* **Result:** The computer blocked the login and displayed the error: *"Your account has been disabled. Please see your system administrator."* This proves the security steps were effective.
