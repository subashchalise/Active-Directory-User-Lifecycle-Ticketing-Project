# 🛠️ Active Directory User Lifecycle & Ticketing Project

## 📋 Project Overview
This project simulates a real-world enterprise IT environment using the **JobSkillShare (JSS)** professional lab sandbox. I designed and implemented a tiered **Organizational Unit (OU)** structure from scratch to manage the full user lifecycle while resolving common Help Desk tickets.

## 📂 Active Directory Design
I avoided the default "Users" container to implement a professional, scalable hierarchy under the **FCTS** root OU.

```text
ACILABS.COM (Root)
└── FCTS (Top Level OU)
    ├── Groups (Security Groups)
    ├── Users (Employee Accounts)
    │   ├── IT
    │   ├── HR
    │   └── Marketing
    └── Computers (Workstations)
```
