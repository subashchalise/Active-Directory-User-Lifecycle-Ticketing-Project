# 🛠️ Active Directory User Lifecycle & Ticketing Project

## 📋 Project Overview
This project simulates a real-world enterprise IT environment using the **JobSkillShare (JSS)** professional lab sandbox. I designed and implemented a tiered **Organizational Unit (OU)** structure from scratch to manage the full user lifecycle while resolving common Help Desk tickets.

## 📂 Active Directory Design (OU Structure)
I avoided the default "Users" container to implement a professional, scalable hierarchy under the **FCTS** root OU:

```text
ACILABS.COM (Root)
└── FCTS (Top Level OU)
    ├── Groups (Security Groups)
    ├── Users (Employee Accounts)
    │   ├── IT
    │   ├── HR
    │   └── Marketing
    └── Computers (Workstations)
```

### 🟢 Ticket 1: New Hire Onboarding
> **Scenario: A new hire, Sarah Jenkins, requires an account in the IT department. The goal is to provision access following the company's security and OU hierarchy.

#### **Technical Actions:**
* **Provisioning:** Created the user object `sjenkins` within the **FCTS > Users > IT** Organizational Unit.
* **Access Control:** Established the `IT-Group` Security Group in the **Groups** OU and assigned Sarah as a primary member.
* **Verification:** Logged into the **Windows 11 Client** workstation as `sjenkins`. Executed the `whoami /groups` command to verify that the Kerberos Security Token was correctly issued with the new group SID.

#### **📸 Technical Evidence:**

**1. ADUC Provisioning: Creating the `sjenkins` User Object** ![User Creation](images/ticket2a.png)

**2. Group Assignment: Adding Sarah to the `IT-Group` Security Group** ![Group Member](images/ticket2c.png)

**3. Client Verification: `whoami /groups` Command Execution** ![whoami Command](images/ticket2d.png)
